# Statistics support in STACK.

By default STACK loads the following optional packages into Maxima to provide statistics support:

    load("stats");
    load("distrib");
    load("descriptive");

Please see Maxima's documentation for information on the functions these packages contain.

## Package: descriptive

Note that the "descriptive" package includes a number of functions to plotting graphs, such as boxplots and scatterplot.  These are not supported by STACK.
